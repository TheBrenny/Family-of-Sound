The Family of Sound was born with the idea of artistic creativity in music and programming! With the help of the friendly neighbourhood [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js), the FoS has grown from a small spectrum which dances to music to a full on family with their own characters, with loves, hates, and lifetime of experiences to learn!
